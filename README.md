# ADASPy
An implementation of the [Automatic Design of Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08435) paper in Python.

There's a [Weaviate Recipe](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/llm-frameworks/dspy/Meta-Agent-Generation.ipynb) for the generation part of the paper already which served as a starting point. It works with [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy).
